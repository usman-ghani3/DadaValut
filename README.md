## Introduction

In this project, we use React to create a user-friendly web application for minting NFTs. The application interacts with a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) to create and manage these tokens. Users can create and customize their NFTs, set attributes, and mint them on the blockchain.

## Features

- Mint NFTs with customizable attributes.
- Manage and view your NFT collection.
- Interact with a blockchain for secure NFT creation and management.
- Responsive and user-friendly web interface.
